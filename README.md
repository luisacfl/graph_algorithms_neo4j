From https://github.com/neo4j-graph-analytics/book/tree/master/data download transport-nodes.csv and transport-relationships.csv. When downloaded, remove the " character in order to be able to import the data and place those files in 'file:/Users/yourusername/Library/Application%20Support/Neo4j%20Desktop/Application/neo4jDatabases/database-IDNUMBER/installation-3.5.6/import/FILENAME.csv' folder.

Create a new database using the Neo4j application and install both Graph Algorithms and APOC plugins. Once you have installed them, run the node and relationship creation scripts. 

Once those are created it is now possible to run the scripts found in the book.
